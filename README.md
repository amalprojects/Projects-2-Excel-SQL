-	Most of the breakdowns are occuring due to Mechanical						
failures and "Wont start" which can be classed as a mechanical						
failures.						
						
- Potential solution - Bus servicing and repairs should be done on 						
a more frequent basis, maybe weekly or monthly in order to reduce						
the frequency of mechanical failure. 

- Most common reason for buses running late is due to Heavy						
traffic.  "Running late" constitutes 93.5% of the reason for delays 						
						
- Potential solution - Pick up school children during times when traffic 						
is low or search for alternate route where traffic density is lesser.

## How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?

The above graph represents the number of incidents involving delays per bus company 								
The higher the number of incidents, the more the cause for concern .								
								
								
Conclusion: Investigate these bus services to find out the reason for the 								
frequent breakdowns or latenesses and advise accordingly or fire.								
								
Check the frequency of runs by these buses. Also, a bus service having higher frequency								
of incidents doesn’t necessarily indicate that their delay time is high for most cases as well.								
This will need to be further investigated.

-The above graph shows the top ten bus services that have the highest average 									
delay time in a span of 5 years	 of the last few years. 		. 						
									
-Should be compared to number of delays , boroughs  and total number of trips.									
									
-Pride Transportation raises a red flag. If you look at the previous graph, the number of incidents 									
involving delays for Pride is in the top 10, and if you look at the above graph, the bus service is in the top 3 									
-in terms of delay time as well. Higher frequency and higher delay times for this company is not 									
a good sign and needs to be investigated.

-Boroughs around NYC have the most cases where the bus services 						
get delayed ( most likely due to heavy traffic as that’s the most						
common reason for delay as per the above graph).

- The boroughs with the highest number of delay times is the main areas of 							
New york county							
This area has the highest concentration of people and vehicles which would explain							
the longer delay times.
