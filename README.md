-	Most of the breakdowns are occuring due to Mechanical						
failures and "Wont start" which can be classed as a mechanical						
failures.						
						
- Potential solution - Bus servicing and repairs should be done on 						
a more frequent basis, maybe weekly or monthly in order to reduce						
the frequency of mechanical failure. M

- Most common reason for buses running late is due to Heavy						
traffic.  "Running late" constitutes 93.5% of the reason for delays 						
						
- Potential solution - Pick up school children during times when traffic 						
is low or search for alternate route where traffic density is lesser.
